- Why I created this site:
    + revamp of previous portfolio site
    + inclusion of blog
    + try out new tech

- What you'll find in the blog:
    + concise thoughts, because you already have enough to digest in your daily life
    + precise tutorials, because I hate walkthroughs that seem to levitate over crucial parts
    + hello-world-series, coming up: Yeoman, Slush, Polymer, Famo.us, Browserify, Angular

- How I built it:
    + Jekyll
    + Bayse (Coffee, Myth, Gulp) -> more to come in next post!
