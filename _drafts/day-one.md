As the Internet mourns the loss of my old website, the Internet rejoices in the arrival of my new website.

I started building my original portfolio site sometime around December 2012 when I began becoming disillusioned with my then job. I finished building it around two months later - when I became irreversibly disillusioned with said job. I took up a new role in May 2013 and have learned an absolute shed-load in the past year. So, I thought it was about time I updated my portfolio to reflect my development. I wanted a fresh, (slightly) maturer look in line with my latest skills but also a nod toward the process of learning. Hence my foray into the world of Blog.

> My hope is that by having a platform to write on I will explore more and take the time to cement what I discover.

To further maximise the value of creating a new site, I decided to look into some new tech to try out. Enter Jekyll. I first came across Jekyll via [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com/2012/11/brander-newer/) and thought it seemed like a good fit for me.

- Why I created this site:
    + revamp of previous portfolio site
    + inclusion of blog
    + try out new tech

- What you'll find in the blog:
    + concise thoughts, because you already have enough to digest in your daily life
    + precise tutorials, because I hate walkthroughs that seem to levitate over crucial parts
    + hello-world-series, coming up: Yeoman, Slush, Polymer, Famo.us, Browserify, Angular
    + very much the unofficial word - I don't claim to be the Oracle on anything and would advise you to tread your own path

- How I built it:
    + Jekyll
    + Bayse (Coffee, Myth, Gulp) -> more to come in next post!
		+ GH pages - free and open source, for community edits...
		+ Repo
