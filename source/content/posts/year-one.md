### My first year as a website

Here we are, a year on.

### The Year in Review

Jekyll is out. Bloat, Ruby, slow unappealing process. Starting Blocks (Gulp, ES6, Ractive, SASS, Markdown, Divshot [GH]) with blog bolted on is in. With a slight redesign.

- Is Jekyll dead?
- The need to redesign
- Measuring success - comments, tweets, analytics
- Future posts, thought-based.
- Shift to ES6, SASS
- Future of JS - yearly iterations
- Should we give up? -> www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/07/stop_pushing_th.html
- Why do we constantly change, why is JS so fluid and `undefined`?
- React/Redux
- Inuit/ITCSS/BEM/namespacing
