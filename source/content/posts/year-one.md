### My first year as a website

Here we are, a year on. This is a huge amount of time in frontend web development. This time last year I was compiling-the-hell-out-of-everything with CoffeeScript and Stylus, dabbled with Angular (!?) and built this site with Jekyll.

### Is Jekyll dead?

For me, yes. For everyone else, no idea. It felt good at the time: it was new, free, used cool shit like YAML front-matter and had good docs. But it quickly grew out of control - I contracted Jekyll-Bloat. I had so many folders for such a small site; it didn't seem logical. Jekyll is also blog-centric whereas the focus of this site is my portfolio - with a little bit of blog thrown in. For a blog-centric platform the writing experience was pretty unappealing and slow. It was also built on Ruby - a language I don't know and wouldn't otherwise use; this didn't make sense either.

### (ES.) Next!

I wanted my site to be an expression of how I enjoy building every other site I work on: structured, crafted and progressive. I took [Starting Blocks](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/slush-starting-blocks) (the framework we use at work) and bolted a Markdown->JSON Gulp task to it - so now writing/publishing is super easy. The stack consists of ES2015 via [Babel](babeljs.io), [Ractive](ractivejs.org) and SASS. I'm also using [ITCSS](itcss.io) and [InuitCSS](https://github.com/inuitcss/) to add serious structure to my CSS. Happy days!

I also felt the need to re-design my site. This fitted with the move to a much more structured approach to writing CSS but also allowed me to freshen things up. I'm using more imagery and some neat CSS animations/transitions to liven things up.

### Worth it?

For me, yes. For everyone else, no idea. Let time and Google Analytics be my judge. In the past year I've had 3,769 user sessions (85% of which were first-time sessions) and 6,123 pageviews but an average session duration of just 49s. This means people are having a look but not sticking around. Rude bastards. Hopefully the fresh style and some more focussed posts will change this. See you next year!
