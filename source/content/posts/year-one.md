### My first year as a website

Here we are, a year on.

### The Year in Review

Jekyll is out. Bloat, Ruby, slow unappealing process. Starting Blocks with blog bolted on is in. With a slight redesign.

- Is Jekyll dead?
- The need to redesign
- Measuring success - comments, tweets, analytics
- Future posts, thought-based.
