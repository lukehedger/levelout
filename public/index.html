            The world needs software that is modern yet stable, balanced
            skillfully between innovation and standards. The applications built

            As a seasoned software engineer, I have worked at all layers of the
            stack building things that are maintainable and long-lasting with a

            to serverless platforms, blockchain networks to viral marketing
            websites, open source tools and a pineapple delivery system. I've
            worked for early-stage startups, international corporations,
            prominent charities and infamous advertising agencies.

          <p><b>Tread</b> - Making analytics simple, powerful and private</p>

          <p>
            It seemed about time to bring analytics into the modern age of dev
            tools. So I started Tread: a software behaviour analytics platform
            with a focus on privacy and simplicity.
          </p>

          <p>
            The alpha version features instant install (two lines of code),
            automatic event tracking and a zero configuration dashboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually, Tread will make state-of-the-art BI tools accessible to
            every developer so they can use analytics data to power their design
            decisions.

            <b>Kit Pics</b> - Swipe your way through every Premier League kit
          </p>

          <p>
            I was listening to an episode of That Peter Crouch podcast when they
            came out with the phrase "kit pics". I had a thought: imagine a site
            where you could like or dislike all home and away football kits from
            every Premier League season, from 1992 to 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            I built an early version and showed a few people. They immediately
            became absorbed in swiping through the kits, going through feelings
            of nostalgia and horror.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the prospect of app developer fame, I made a few optimisations
            and added a stats page, showing favourite teams, years and kits. Now
            waiting for it to go viral.

          <p><b>Rubber Tracks</b> - Converse</p>

          <p>
            Worked closely with an in-house designer and the Converse team to
            build this on-going campaign site showcasing emerging London bands
            and their stories. Each band's story could be read by following
            their Street View-powered journey around London and listening to a
            selection of tracks.
          </p>

          <p>
            The site also included an explorable map of promotional events and
            multiple social network feeds.
          </p>

          <p>
            An early (~2015) component-driven web application, built with
            Ractive.js, a pre-cursor to React.js.

          <p><b>Analytics Hub</b> - Land Rover</p>

          <p>
            Shipped a realtime social analytics dashboard to allow Land Rover to
            monitor their ad campaign impact with aggregated insights, generated
            from data across multiple platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The dashboard was powered by a Node.js server that collected and
            stored social data and streamed it to a server-rendered UI, complete
            with interactive charts and exportable reports.
